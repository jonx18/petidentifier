# petidentifier
This is a pet identifier model for my family's pets. 

Some images that no were use in the training could be found in the pets folder.

- Pet identifier model with only a resnet. [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jonx18/petidentifier/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fpetidentifier_web.ipynb)
- Extension of pet identifier to pet and family identifier with an 18 resnet. [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jonx18/petidentifier/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fpetandfamilyidentifier_web.ipynb)
- [Pet and Family identifier V2](https://share.streamlit.io/jonx18/petidentifier/main/petandfamilyidentifier_streamlit_app.py) powered by Streamlit.
- Pet and Family identifier V4 (yes I skipped V3) powered by Streamlit will be accessible in the multipage portfolio. It works over the data imbalance for human classes :joy:.Â
